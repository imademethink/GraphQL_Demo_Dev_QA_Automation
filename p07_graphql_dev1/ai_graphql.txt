what is graphql

thanks, could you provide a realistic module or project where graphql is more benificial compared to REST

==> Project: E-commerce Product Detail Page (PDP)

Based on above input, let's design a project for E-commerce Product Detail Page
it is docker based project
programming langauge is Python latest
graph query query as following : 


if request is correct then return 200 status code and valid response 

HTTP POST method by default

graphql aggrecator 	- QUERY
					- NESTED GRAPHQL query
graphql mutations 		- CREATE a resource at backend
graphql subscriptions 	- for data changes - ONCREATE

gql - schema

prompt ====
Based on the context of above discussion, please design a simple python and docker based project.
It is for simple E-commerce Product Detail Page.
it is docker based project.
Programming langauge is Python with latest version.
When user hits GraphQL query it returs product name, and product price.
Provide the entire code with exact folder structure.
Provide the required gql file.

Consider above entire discussion as the context.
It is for simple E-commerce Product Detail Page.
it is docker based project.
Programming langauge is Python with latest version.
When user hits GraphQL query it returs product name, product price, product supplier.
Each product has three supplier. So GraphQL has nested response for product supplier section.
Please generate relevant code.
Again provide the entire code with exact folder structure.
Provide the required gql file.

thanks, pls just update graphql query for a specific location e.g. London so that I can use this query in postman
query {
product(id: "1") {
name

suppliers {companyName, location}}}

don't change any python code


prompt ====
thanks
now consider I have to development automation for given schema.graphql file.
automation is a seperate project.
seperate project is not docker based. seperate project code does not have any access to source code.
seperate project uses python language with latest version.
pls generate simple automation and provide entire code.

now Consider above entire discussion as the context.
ignore the automation part.
It is for simple E-commerce Product Detail Page.
it is docker based project.
Programming langauge is Python with latest version.
When user hits GraphQL query it returs product name, product price, product supplier.
Each product has three supplier. So GraphQL has nested response for product supplier section.
Add Mutations so user can delete a product.
Please generate relevant code.
Again provide the entire code with exact folder structure.
Provide the required gql file.
